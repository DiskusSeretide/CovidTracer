# Population traffic data for control COVID-19 dispersion

# The aim of this work is to develop a population data system, which attendance of points of interest and management of possible contact with a COVID-19 case.
Managing the pandemic by COVID-19 and its aftermath is a challenge in many countries of the world. Multipliers can be used to control possible dispersal
Traffic data already collected by providers such as Google and related to frequency of visits to geographical points of interest (POIs), such as shops, restaurants,
services during the day and week (popular times). The traffic density can act as an indicator of a place's popularity, but also as risk factor for possible spread of COVID-19. 
At the same time, it is only an estimate based on geographical location data and does not depend on the actual number of visitors to a site. It would therefore be useful to enable a visitor to contribute his or her own estimate of the actual number of visitors. By retaining the visit information anonymously, it can be combined with a possible case entry, so that other users are informed if they were in the same area with a reported case. Thus, the purpose of this work is to build a system of mass collection of traffic data and possible case reporting in order to provide traffic information to points of interest, but also to inform about possible contact with a reported case, as a means of controlling the spread.
